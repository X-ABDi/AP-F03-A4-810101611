    Its type is “int (*)(char,float)” if an ordinary function
    Its type is “int (Fred::*)(char,float)” if a non-static member function of class Fred

for initializing or adding to my user defined map there is no = overloaded thus insert() 
    does not work too. maybe implace() works.
    because it is an ordered map,, so i change it to unordered map.
    so i got implicit instantiation of undefined template.
    EMPLACE() JUST WORKED!!! AND I AM FIGURETIVELY CRYING :))))

fucccccckkk for static members you have to define them,, allocating some memory or you obviously 
    can not use or modify it.

it's a nasty try to have a static functions in a class accessing a static map member , to call another
    static function member with arguments :////
    implicit instantiations and calling a static function without appropriate pointer or sth ...
    what a messs !!!

    well using iterators and a bunch of correctoins problem solved.
